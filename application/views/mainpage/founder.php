    <p>Gar Relief was founded by Venerable Dorzin Dhondrup Rinpoche at the request of His Eminence Garchen Rinpoche, a highly revered Tibetan Buddhist lama and head of Gargon Monastery in Nangchen, who currently resides in the United States. Gargon Monastery has been a significant presence in the lives of area residents for hundreds of years.  Venerable Dorzin Dhondrup Rinpoche was born and raised in Dochug village in Nangchen.

In 2007 HE Garchen Rinpoche sent him to Singapore to establish Drigar Thubten Dargye Ling. Ever since, Dorzin Dhondrup Rinpoche has been teaching at Drikung Kagyu dharma centers throughout Asia, the United States, and the European Union.
