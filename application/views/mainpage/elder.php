    <p><span>Achi Elder Care</span> provides subsistence support to the most needy and disadvantaged elders living in Tajuk and neighboring villages. These elders live in dire poverty, have been abandoned by their families or have no family to care for them, and suffer from severe illness or physical disabilities. With no support, these elderly face immense hardships and suffering.</p>
    <p>Gar Relief has identified 32 of the neediest elders living in Tajuk and the surrounding areas. To help meet their daily needs, we provide each elder with a daily stipend to cover the cost of food, clothing, and basic medical care. We also provide a stipend of $150/month each to two local caretakers who assist with elder care. Lama Wangchen, an ordained Buddhist monk, is our liaison on the ground who works to ensure the elders are cared for and their needs are met.</p>
    <p>A small gift goes a long way to help to lessen their suffering. Consider making a monthly sustaining donation.</p>
