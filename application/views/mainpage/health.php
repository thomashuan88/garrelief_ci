    <h3>HEALTH CARE</h3>
    <p>People living Nangchen are exposed to a harsh, high-altitude climate with scant vegetation and poor nutrition, conditions that usually lead to overall general poor health. Yet basic healthcare for poor residents in remote villages is non-existent. To receive medical care, residents have to travel long distances and many die en route. Many often forego healthcare altogether. Simple wounds cripple and fester, and minor illnesses have serious consequences due to a lack of proper medical attention.</p>
    <p>The closest hospital to Tajuk village for emergency or critical care with surgical capabilities is in Jyekundo (Yushu), about a 9-hour drive in a reliable vehicle when the road is passable, or several days on foot or horseback. There is also a clinic in Sharda, the Nangchen County seat, about a 4-hour drive from Tajuk. Since most villagers and nomads don’t have vehicles, they have difficulty reaching these towns even when the road is drivable.</p>
    <p>Residents have significant health care needs, many chronic and some critical. Common ailments are respiratory illness from exposure to smoke from burning yak dung or wood for heating and cooking, gastrointestinal problems, gallbladder disease, hypertension and malnutrition. Eye disorders are also common from exposure to the strong ultraviolet rays in high altitudes.</p>
    <p>Women and children are especially vulnerable. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates 1 in 33 births results in the mother’s death, compared with 1 in 2,800 in developed countries. Approximately 1 in every 8 newborns does not survive. In the year 2000, life expectancy at birth was reported as 59.3 years for males and 62.0 years for females.</p>
    <p>Many health issues can be prevented with simple solutions. Education around personal hygiene, diet and nutrition, and regular medical check ups can make a big difference in their health.</p>
