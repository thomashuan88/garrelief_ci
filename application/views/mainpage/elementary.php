    <p>The <span>Gar Tajuk Elementary School</span> currently provides 31 students ages 6 to 9 who otherwise would not have access to a grade school education. The children come from poor nomadic families living in the surrounding areas. They have no means of travel and no money to pay for a state education.  Many of them walk long distances in a harsh, high altitude environment (over 14,500 feet) to attend school to learn subjects such as Tibetan and Chinese languages, reading and math.</p>
    <p>With your donations, Gar Relief provides a free primary school education, funding for hot meals for both students and staff; basic wages for 2 teachers, a cook and a caretaker; and school supplies such as books and pens. The schoolâ€™s monthly operating costs are $2,000 or $65 per child. Before Gar Relief stepped in to provide support, the school was on the verge of closing.</p>
