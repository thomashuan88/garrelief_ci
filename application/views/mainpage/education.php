    <h3>EDUCATION</h3>
    <p>One of the best ways to build local communities is to educate the children. We believe education, more than anything else, strengthens human capacity and helps people to take control of their lives and break poverty's vicious grip.</p>
    <p>Children living in remote areas of the Tibetan Plateau have no means of transportation and must walk long distances in a harsh, high altitude environment to attend school. One of the poorest areas of the world, they also have no money to pay for a state education.</p>
    <p>Gar Relief encourages nomadic families to send their children to school to receive a basic primary education, which is vital to their future selfsufficiency. At the Gar Tajuk Elementary School, children receive a free education, school supplies, texts, desks and chairs, and two hot meals a dayâ€”necessary because of the long distance from their homes. Additional expenses to run the school include teacher salaries, cook and caretaker salaries, maintaining the school building, and transporting food from lower elevations.</p>
    <p>To sustain an ongoing educational program in such a remote area is difficult, and schools must be sufficiently and steadily funded to continue operating.</p>
