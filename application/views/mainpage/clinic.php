    <p>The <span>Bendurya Medical Clinic</span> is a dignified place for residents to access basic, low-cost healthcare and wound treatment using both Tibetan and Allopathic medicines. The clinic also offers educational programs around hygiene and preventative health.</p>
    <p>The Bendurya Medical Clinic represents a milestone for Tajuk and the surrounding area. Before Bendurya Clinic was established, the nearest clinic was hours away by car, which few residents have, and even longer by foot or horseback. The nearest hospital is a nine-hour drive on impassable roads or several days by foot or horseback. Many patients died en route or did not seek treatment and died of their ailments. Now, because of your donations, hundreds of residents in Tajuk and surrounding areas have access to lowcost, basic medical care and health education. Dr. Norde, a trained Tibetan doctor, heads the clinic. He is assisted by one nurse.</p>
    <p>Gar Relief provides funding to support purchases of essential medical supplies, equipment and medicines as well as wages for the doctor and nurse. The clinic is still in the start up phase, and funding is needed to purchase essential medical equipment and supplies to build operational capacity.</p>
    <p>With your help, basic healthcare is more accessible than ever. But more must be done to meet local medical needs.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>$350 pays for a month's supply of medicine</li>
        <li>$250 covers Dr. Norde's wages for one month</li>
        <li>$85 covers the nurse's wages for one month</li>
        <li class="italic bold">A sustained monthly donation in any amount helps keep the clinic open</li>
