    <h3>WE ARE AN INTERNATIONAL, ALL VOLUNTEER CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION</h3>
    <p>Gar Relief's work is inspired by the service tradition of compassion in action and the practice of generosity.  We are an international, all volunteer charitable organization.  Because volunteers and sponsors cover administrative expenses, 100% of your donation goes directly to benefit our projects and people.</p>
    <h3>100% OF YOUR DONATION GOES DIRECTLY TO FUND PROJECTS</h3>
    <p>Gar Relief has long-term experience in the region. Our founder, Venerable Dorzin Dhondrup Rinpoche, originally comes from Nangchen. We focus on small-scale grassroots development projects and work directly with locals and local government officials to carry out the activities on the ground. Gar Relief local volunteers regularly monitor our projects. Gar Relief international volunteers make annual site visits to monitor project activities, assess needs, and evaluate progress.</p>
    <p class="bold">Gar Relief Has Experienced Serving the Region</p>
    <p class="bold big">We strive to make a sustainable, long-term positive impact on the quality of life for the people we serve.</p>
